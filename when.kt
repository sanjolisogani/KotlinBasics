/*
*In Kotlin, when replaces the switch operator of other languages like Java.
*The argument of when expression compares with all the branches
* one by one until some match is found. After the first match found,
*  it reaches to end of the when block and execute the code next to
* when block.
* In Kotlin, when can be used in two ways:

    when as a statement
    when as an expression
